# 20240 - Slingy Shawty Roadruner Quickstart - Ishaan D 

I (Ishaan D)) made this Roadrunner Quickstart Repo for team 20240 Slingyshawty!
Check out **mechanisms_and_movement** folder to see auton(***AutonConcept.java***) everything else is 100% tuning for roadrunner

This is beneficial because it has a SampleAutoConcept.java file which basically is an ITD autonomous program
I have created code for all subsystems and set up this repo in such a way, that when cloned can be easily used for any robot

Check out the mechanisms_and_movement folder which includes everything I created :)
This quickstart is made for a 2 deadwheel robot
